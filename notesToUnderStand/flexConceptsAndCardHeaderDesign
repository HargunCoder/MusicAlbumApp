The concepts in flex we are going to use for designing our card Header
we are going to position Image Text Text
lets talk about some values we can give to justify content
  -by default everything will be aligned to top left of the CardItem
  -flex-end-
  all multiple contents are aligned to bottom right corner
  -center
  all content is placed in left center
  -space-between
  maximize and equalize space between each Component
  top item along top margin bottom item along bottom margin
  -space-around
  equal spacing between all items including top and bottom margins having
  spacing between elements

  So to handle our problem we divide our text and image in two viewS
  -one view will have the image tag
  -the other view will have have both the Text tags placed one below the another
  we want both these views to be aligned to top and besides each other .
  we use justifyContent:'flex-start' to align these two views to start.

  the issue that arises is that justifyContent till now has worked only vertically
  how to make it work horizontally

  For that we use flexDirection property,it has two values it can take:
  1)flexDirection:'column'
    all of the flex direction rules applied using justifyContent is applied to vertiacl direction
  2)flexDirection:'row'
   all of the flex direction rules will be applied using justifyContent in horizontal direction

   so this is how we will position the two views,now next issue is how to style in the view so
   that both text tags come one below another.

   for that we will style the view tag containing the texts to have flexDirection vertical i.e column.
   So lets create a container for text called text container which will have the two text below each other.
   we will use justifyContent:spaceAround to give proper spacing.
