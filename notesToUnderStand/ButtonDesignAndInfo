We have to add clicking ability to our button.
now there are 4 types of Responses available to a button in react native
  1 TouchableOpacity
  2 TouchableHighlight
  3 TouchableNativeFeedback
  4 TouchableWithoutFeedback
Lets talk about TouchableOpacity that we are going to use know
-Its a wrapper for making Views respojd to touches.
-So the views we want to be clickable we place in between
<TouchableOpacity></TouchableOpacity>
-its different from other button types because here when user clicks on
 the opacity of wrapped view decreases,dimming it
 -Opacity is controlled by wrapping the children in an Animated.View,
 - which is added to the view hierarchy.
 - Be aware that this can affect layout.
 eg.
 <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPressButton}>
     <Image
       style={styles.button}
       source={require('./myButton.png')}
     />
   </TouchableOpacity>
  Props.
  -activeOpacity
   Determines what opacity of wrapped view should be when touch is active
   its a number
   Methods
   setOpacityTo()
   setOpacityTo((value: number), (duration: number));
Animate the touchable to a new opacity.

To add some action when user presses or give some input something happens
 we can achieve this by using onPress prop to TouchableOpacity
 we have created onPress handler which does something that does an action
 when button pressed.
 we want to add onPress in such a way that it can be a general tag
 so we use pass a prop say whenPressed.
 now this will pass the data to button component.
 now we have to make sure that the button uses that function.


Now we are passong a function to button using props.
  <Button whenPressed={() => console.log(title)} />
  we give prop to the button component
  and we use it using
   onPress={whenPressed}

Next challenge is how to open a website through our app
to accomplish this we will use Linking Library of React.
We use the function Linking.OpenURL(url) to open our Link
Read Linking
Next we want to have to see how we display the text on a button.
we have two ways
1)Add it as a prop with the button function
2)expand button and use props.children to send text.
