We have
  App.js as Root element which is having-
    -Header (which is in src/Components/Header)
      displays header passed as HeaderText
    -AlbumList
      function is to fetch list of Multiple AlbumDetails and display them

  we had an issue of how to display the albums which we get as json file
  The approach we chose:
    create two files
    1 AlbumDetails
      function is to fetch only details of a single album
      containing title, autor ,image etc
    2 AlbumList
      function is to fetch list of Multiple AlbumDetails and display them
    Tree looks like
    App -> AlbumList -> Multiple AlbumDetails
